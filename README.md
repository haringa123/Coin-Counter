# Coin-Counter
I made a simple program in pygame that lets you keep track of the amount and value of your coins!

In the quick demo video I scroll through my code and the program, Coin Counter. I spent 6 hours on it, as I am a beginner. I learned a lot about coding, and how to simplify it. I cut a lot of code out by making a dictionary. I got more comfortable with coding, and learned that it is suitable for me. I was scared that I wouldn't be able to create much, but I found that the process was enjoyable, and I learned a lot- especially the difference between a beginners code and the mindset of those who are more advanced, when I looked up pygame tutorials. I learned from a few videos and the pygame documentation. I made my code as original as possible. The way I learned from different videos was seeing how they managed to make a loop for the game, include sprites, effects etc. It took a lot of experimentation to see what went wrong. I was surprised that I was able to come up with solutions and original code.
